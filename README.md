# Description

This resource pack adds a handful of quality-of-life improvements and a fresh menu screen, designed for the Create: Genesis modpack.  This resource pack is configured to be optional within that modpack, enabled by default.  Genesis: Extras makes few changes to the in-game textures, so it is minimalistic and can be easily overriden by players' other preferred resource packs.

**Please note that this is NOT intended to be a stand-alone resource pack and does very little without the Create: Genesis modpack (coming soon)!**
